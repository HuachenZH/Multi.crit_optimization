# Multi.crit_optimization
Multi-criteria optimization &amp; goal programming
A course of data science, which aimes at the optimization by Matlab.
The problems to be optimized are mostly linear and aren't complex. It's rather for getting used to Matlab (especially work with all thoses vectors and matrix) and for understanding what are decision variables and objective functions in an optimization problem.

In course 1 and 2 I've put Matlab script file so that you can preview. However it's clearer to download the liveScript file.
